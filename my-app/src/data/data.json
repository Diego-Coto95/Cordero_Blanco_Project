  "About": {
    "paragraph": "The name Cordero Blanco comes from the combination of surnames of a peasant family from San Gerardo de Tarrazú who were 14 siblings led by Luis Cordero and Esther Blanco. This family grew up in a peasant environment where apart from coffee other activities were developed such as the production of candy (cane), cattle, beans, corn, and achiote charcoal, among others. The activities were abundant and the work seemed never to end in a family that fought tirelessly and that hoped through effort to get ahead and grow despite the adversities that health and life showed over the years. After a few years, coffee became the favorite crop not only for the Cordero Blanco family, but also for the Zona de los Santos who were already receiving the first colones thanks to its sale and commercialization that began to take place in the mid-19th century seem successful in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. This is how the culture of coffee was installed until today leaving large plots of land planted with different varieties and different types of soil.",
